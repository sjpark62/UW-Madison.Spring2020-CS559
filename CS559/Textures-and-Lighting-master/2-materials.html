<h2 id="material-property-maps">Material Property Maps</h2>
<p>Up until now, we've only been using texture to change colors. However, we can use a texture to control just about any property of a material. If you look at the documentation for <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code>, you can see a lot of the things we control about materials (like roughness, emission, and metalness) can be controlled with a map as well instead of giving a single value for the entire object.</p>
<p>For this exercise, pick one (or more) of those properties, and make a map that controls the property over the object. You need to make something where it is obvious what is going on. This means created a texture with variation, having an appropriate object to show (a primitive like a sphere is often good enough), and maybe some adjustments to the lighting.</p>
<p>Note: to show that you haven't just changed the colors, you probably want to make either the light or the object move (with animation).</p>
<p>You will probably want to create your own texture map. Make sure you include it in the repository.</p>

<p>Material property maps are a simple kind of map. We'll talk about variants of normal maps on the <a href="3-normal.html">next page</a>.</p>
