			<p>The pedagogical goals of this exercise are to give you practice defining shapes with meshes and adding textures to them.</p>
<p>In graphics town, you will need vehicles. A cars, trucks, trains, or maybe other things.</p>
<p>So in this page, please make one. It has to have wheels on the ground. But other than that, few restrictions - you can have a primitive (like a box or something) for the body. The vehicle must either have shape or texture to make it look like a car/truck/train.</p>
<p>Here are some simple ones from that 2000 graphics town I mentioned. You should be able to make something nicer.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/car1.png" height="200px" /> <img src="../../images/car2.png" height="200px" /></p>
<p>If you want a simple train made out of primitives, you can look at <a href="https://discoverthreejs.com/book/1-first-steps/6-shapes-transformations/">this tutorial</a> for a simple train made out of primitives. If you use it, be sure to give attribution (and put it into the graphics town framework).</p>
<p>To get the points for this page, you just have to have a simple car (defined as a <code>GrObject</code> in <a href="../../for_students/7-car.js" class="for_students">7-car.js</a> and placed into the world in <a href="../../for_students/7-1.js" class="for_students">7-1.js</a>. Of course, it can be a fancier vehicle. Don&rsquo;t worry about making it drive around (that&rsquo;s a future workbook).</p>
<iframe src="../../for_students/7-1.html" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;height:100%;width:100%;border: 2px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>
<p>You will need vehicles for the future assignments, so effort you put into making nice vehicles now will pay off in future workbooks. You can make more vehicle types later - but you may want to do some of the work now.</p>
<p>The rules for finding and importing object files and textures are the same as for <a href="../../docs/6/">Page6(Graphics Town Buildings (Exercise 4))</a>.</p>
<p>Your Vehicles should be subclasses of <code>GrObject</code>. Your work goes into <a href="../../for_students/7-car.js" class="for_students">7-car.js</a> and modify <a href="../../for_students/7-1.js" class="for_students">7-1.js</a>. You&rsquo;ll see it in <a href="../../for_students/7-1.html" class="for_students">7-1.html</a>.</p>
